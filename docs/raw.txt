Yuck. The name says it all. We didn’t make this to win taste tests. We made it to work — clean, potent, no-nonsense nutrition for people who care more about results than sweetness.

Section 2 — “Why Yuck?”
We stripped away the sugar, the artificial flavors, and the fake promises. What’s left is raw performance — the kind that actually does something.

Section 3 — “How to Use”
Mix one scoop with water. Hold your breath if you must. Feel the difference.
It’s that simple — not that pleasant.

Tagline Footer:
Good for your body. Brutal for your mouth.

ABOUT PAGE

Headline:
The Truth Behind Yuck.

Body Copy:
Yuck started as a challenge — to make something that works, not something that panders. We wanted a natural pre-workout that does what it says, without the syrupy nonsense or gimmick science.

It’s made from simple, powerful ingredients. The same kind every other supplement hides under fancy labels — we just decided to stop pretending it tastes good.

Section Header:
We’re not here to please your palate. We’re here to fuel your performance.

Team Line:
Created by real people who actually use the stuff.

Closing Line:
Because the truth is: if it tastes good, it’s probably lying to you.
